# Software Dev Group Project 

  This was a group project taken in the second year of university. It mimicked a industry like project where we had to liaise with clients and stakeholders in order to implement a set of requirements. The project was to 
  implement a patient booking system for a doctors surgery. 

There were 3 other people in the group with myself and we split the workload equally. My main responsibilities were implementing back end features, all the testing including documentation and quality assurance documents.
In the end due to other group members failing to complete certain tasks I ended up doing a lot more than originally intended.

The project used JDBC to connect to a database stored on the university server. We passed SQL requests to the database and then manipulated the data received in order to fulfill tasks performed by the user.
