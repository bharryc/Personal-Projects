# HTML Scraper

This was a simple HTML scraper built using Python that I used to extract metadata about papers submitted to the ICWSM conference. 
The information extracted from these links were the paper title, author names and institutions, keywords, abstract, date, and paper type.
The results were saved into JSON files.
